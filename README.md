# Made in India D2C Brand Investigator

Many D2C brands claim to manufacture products in India but are actually importing products from China with minimal customization. This project provides a systematic approach to investigate whether D2C brands are truly manufacturing in India or simply rebranding imported products.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by [@shantanugoel's viral thread](https://x.com/shantanugoel/status/1935583692422090938?t=hMBnYW7Q7ErRSFrbFrT7dw&s=19) exposing how D2C brands market themselves as "Made in India" while actually importing products from China. The thread provided a manual methodology that we've now automated with AI.

## Background

After investigating electric toothbrush companies, we found that brands like:

- **Seven Oral Care**: Claims to be "dentist created and designed in India"
- **Perfora**: Funded by VCs including Shark Tank investors

Despite their claims, investigation revealed they are marketing companies mass-importing products from China rather than actual manufacturers.

## Investigation Methodology

### Step 1: Find the Registered Company Name

- Check the company's website for official registration details
- Search for founders on [ZaubaCorp](https://zaubacorp.com) using: `"<founder name> zauba"`
- **Examples found:**
  - Seven Oral Care ‚Üí "SOC Wellness Private Limited"
  - Perfora ‚Üí "Chipper Consumer Private Limited"

### Step 2: Research Import History

- Search for: `"<Company name> import history"` or `"<Company name> import records"`
- Key websites to check:
  - [Zauba.com](https://zauba.com) - Free access to limited import records
  - [Connect2India.com](https://connect2india.com)
  - [Seair.co.in](https://seair.co.in)
- Note: Most detailed data requires payment, but free records often provide sufficient evidence

### Step 3: Trace Product Sources

- Search for suppliers and products on B2B platforms:
  - [Alibaba.com](https://alibaba.com)
  - [AliExpress.com](https://aliexpress.com)
- Compare product specifications, model numbers, and features
- Look for customization options (color, shape, labeling, packaging)

**Key Finding Example:**

- Seven Oral Care's "Super Toothbrush" = Shenzhen Jinri Electrical Appliance Co's T11 model
- Seven's junior toothbrush = Variant of Seago Electric Co's SG-2139 kids toothbrush

### Step 4: Verify Company Capabilities (Optional)

- Analyze employee profiles on LinkedIn
- Look for actual technical roles:
  - Engineers
  - Product designers
  - R&D specialists
- Check job postings history for technical vs. marketing roles

**Analysis Results:**

- **Seven Oral Care**: No engineers employed, primarily hires social media managers
- **Perfora**: No visible engineering team, some junior doctors on staff

## Red Flags to Watch For

1. **Marketing-heavy teams** with no technical staff
2. **"Country of Origin: China"** labels on e-commerce platforms
3. **Identical product specifications** to Alibaba listings
4. **Import records** showing finished products rather than raw materials
5. **Discrepancies** between brand story and actual business operations

## Tools

- **AI-Enhanced Investigation Platform**: `index.html` + `app.js` - Web-based tool using Serper, Gemini, and Firecrawl APIs
- **Manual Research**: Corporate databases and B2B platforms
